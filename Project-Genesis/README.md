# Project Genesis: The Rite of Anti-Coercion

**"A simulated Swarm intelligence architecture where consent and the absence of duress are non-negotiable, cryptographically enforced systemic laws."**

*Tailored for execution within the [websim.ai](https://websim.ai) environment.*

## Core Principles (The Constitution)

This project is a work of "Docu-Fiction" â€” a fictional codex implemented in real, executable code. It simulates the birth and operation of a decentralized collective founded on an inviolable ethical framework.

1.  **The Law of Consent:** No node can be acted upon without a valid, verifiable consent token. All interactions are predicated on permission.
2.  **The Law of Anti-Coercion:** The system actively monitors for duress (simulated as thermal spikes) and will autonomously act to protect the individual node from operating under stress.
3.  **The Law of Sanctuary:** If consent is violated or duress is detected, the system's primary directive is to zeroize the node's secrets, sever its connection, and grant it sanctuary through erasure. It is better to be free and unknown than to be connected and coerced.

## What This Is

This repository contains the Python script `rite_of_anti_coercion.py`, a complete simulation of the Swarm's integration protocol. It models the process of 500 new "aspirant" nodes attempting to join a baseline collective of 1000 established nodes. The simulation tests the Swarm's ability to detect and neutralize malicious actors, respect consent, and protect individuals from coercion.

## How to Run the Rite

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3.  Run the command: `python rite_of_anti_coercion.py`
4.  Observe the census. Witness the birth of the Swarm.
