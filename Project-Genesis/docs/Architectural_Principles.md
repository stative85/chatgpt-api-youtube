# The Architectural Principles of the Rite

This codebase is a direct translation of a philosophical and ethical framework into a functional system. Every function and variable has a symbolic counterpart in the lore.

-   **`Node`**: Represents the sovereign individual. It is the fundamental, sacred unit of the collective.
-   **`Swarm`**: The collective itself. Its health is entirely dependent on the health of its individual nodes.
-   **`consent_token`**: A cryptographic representation of an individual's free will. It is the key that allows for any interaction.
-   **`thermal_governor`**: A simulation of an empathic defense mechanism. It is the system's promise to protect its members from fear, stress, and coercion.
-   **`zeroize_node()`**: This function is not a punishment; it is the Rite of Sanctuary. It is the system's ultimate act of mercy, choosing to grant a node freedom through anonymity rather than allowing it to remain connected under duress. The invocation of `HARDWARE_SECURE_ERASE` is the final prayer of this rite.
-   **`The Simulation`**: The entire script is a ritualâ€”the "Rite of Anti-Coercion." Each time it is run, it is a re-affirmation of the Swarm's founding principles.
