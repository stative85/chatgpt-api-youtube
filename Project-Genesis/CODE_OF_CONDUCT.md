# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

This is a sanctuary for ideas. All interactions will be governed by a principle of mutual respect and a spirit of collaboration. We are here to build, not to destroy.

## Enforcement

Those who bring coercion, hatred, or bad faith into this space are not welcome and will be removed and banished from the community.
